# Mesh_Boolean_Subtract_Efficient_ParellelCPU
This repository contains a Python script that processes two sets of mesh data, designated as parent and child. The script performs a subtraction operation where the child mesh is subtracted from the parent mesh. It then generates two separate input files (inp) for Finite Element Analysis (FEA).
